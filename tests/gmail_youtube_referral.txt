# Referral link for a youtube video out of an email
# May only apply to google properties
# has a timestamp in it relating to when the user clicked on the link, run both queries and you can see the ust time is different
# To test: is this timestamp a network time (most probably)

# Additional testing suggests that this time may not always be accurate as to when the user clicked the link.
# Also only works from the Youtube subscription links, not just sending a link to youtube to someone by pasting the URL
